## Dimensions

What fields can we use to suggest related courses?

First approach: can we simply display some subset of the course's parent topic? (e.g. the next three that are scheduled)

**Because you're on a course page for Conflict Resolution, we will show you three courses from Conflict Resolution that are next scheduled.**

## Other dimensions we could use for "related courses"

* Upcoming *not* unscheduled
* Certificate programs
* List of other courses 
* "sponsoring organisation"
* Landing pages?
* By same instructor
* Umbrella
    - Subtopic (max 5 hidden from end-users)
    - Explicit relationships: this is absolutely related to this other course
    -
